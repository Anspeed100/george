  "text": "My distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life, Niimei, Naamei, Nananom, brothers and sisters, partners in the enterprise of making Ghana become the best version of itself in order that we all may be beneficiaries:\n\nI greet you!\n\nI am George Twum-Barimah-Adu. I am a father of three and married to my beautiful wife, Winifred, who due to surgery, could not join us today.  I take this opportunity to wish her speedy recovery from her surgery.\n\nBeloved brothers and sisters, we have invited you to an event that we have dubbed “The Reveal” – and for very good reason.\n\nWhy “The Reveal?” We chose this title because my team and I seek, with this gathering, to reignite the tough conversations that ought to be had, to spur the birth of ideas, pathways, and policies – a blueprint that can, effectively and efficiently, change the negative course of Ghana – and guide it to a more resilient and prosperous one, built on the very tenets on which the 4th Republic of Ghana, right from its inception, was meant to be anchored: probity, integrity, accountability, and that moral character that generates true selfless servant-leadership.\n\nIt also is an opportunity for me to elaborate on who I am, and why, as might be obvious, at this point, I seek to lead this country, Ghana, as President – and to share what my plan is.\n\nI would like to commence it all, however, by taking a short trip down memory lane:\n\nGrowing up, my dear friends and fellow Ghanaians I blossomed in a Ghana which, from where I sat, was filled with promise. Today, however, all we have are the empty promises of an entitled political class! I remember chancing recently upon the Daily Graphic edition of Thursday, March 7, 1957, a day after our beloved nation, Ghana, attained independence, with a caption that read: “What the World Says about Ghana.” \n\nIn that story, it was clear that while there were those who felt our then newborn nation would not succeed, there were many, too, that were optimistic about this new nation and the greatness that could be born from it."
