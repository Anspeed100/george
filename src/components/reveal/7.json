Scrutinizing Public Procurement and strictly reviewing contracts to guarantee value for money. \n\n3. Downsizing government as much as possible.\n\n4. Ensuring that no government entity (including SOE’s) sign any contract or memorandum with any party without government review, input and approval. \n\n5. Cutting down on unnecessary public expenditure, by operating within the constitutionally approved number of 19 Cabinet Ministers, with a total Ministerial count of sixty-three (63).\n\n6. Instituting a cap on the value of state vehicles used by all government officials including SOE’s.\n\n7. Suspending all government and SOE’s travels pending a review, unless essential travels carefully vetted to deliver value for money.All these measures put together, and many more, will, save the nation millions if not billions of cedis annually, surely, putting our beloved country, Ghana, on a far better economic pedestal than we are at now! Through these measures, we shall plug the loopholes of criminal enrichment and corruption and stem the tide of wastage in government! \n\nThis is why together, you and I must break the two, na yen y3 no yie, so that we can be able to implement our Manifesto to ensure that governance is working and serving the people and at the same time, helping create wealth."
