  "text": "I am doing this because I fervently believe it is time to forge a brighter future for every Ghanaian and not only for those who belong to the political party of the President in power. \n\nI will be a Head of State for the people! One who brings about destiny-changing transformation!\n\nThat is why the slogan for my campaign is “Breaking the Two”; and the motto of my candidacy is, “Y3 gye ay3 no yie.” Simply put, “We are taking on governance to make it truly work”. A Head of State (not Head of Party) who serves the needs of all the people and create wealth for everyone.\n\nWhy “Breaking the Two” and why “Y3 gye ay3 no yie”?\n\nPermit me to start off with the slogan:\n\n“Breaking The Two.”\n\nIt depicts, as initially comes to mind, a breaking of the foothold these two known political parties, the NDC and the NPP, have had in Ghana’s politics over recent decades. It is now clear more than ever, that until we extricate ourselves from the tyranny of these two non-performing conjoined twins, we shall continue to have Presidents who serve only their party and it’s supporters and not the totality of Ghanaians. A scenario which so far as we can see has taken our nation nowhere. \n\nAt the time Ghana was declared a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIP C) under former President Kufuor, Ghana had a debt overhead of only $6.6 Billion in 2003, of which a whopping $4.3 Billion was shaved off, through debt cancellation, leading to a debt profile (including other write-offs) of about $780 Million or 25% of GDP when HIPC ended in 2006.\n\nThe NDC, when it took over in 2009, catapulted our public debt from GHS 9.8 Billion to GHS 122.6 Billion, or 73.3% of our GDP in 2016. \n\nBut if that was bad, the NPP did and is doing even worse today!\n\nBy June 2023, this NPP administration had borrowed to the tune of GHS 581.5 Billion! And as of this year, our government projects to borrow a further GHS 94.4 Billion in Treasury Bills to finance its expenditure!"
