  "text": "Now, more than ever, we need to rein in our retrogressive political leadership and change course. We need to put a stop to this vicious cycle of the NDC and the NPP, lest we veer off into a disastrous oblivion as a people and end up in our economic grave! We must break the two, good people of Ghana, and I strongly believe that this is also the Will of God! \n\nNow why, “Y3 gye aye no yie!”\n\nAfter we have broken the two, we must make governance truly work and serve the needs of the people and help create wealth. However, one may ask, how will this be executed, since we are ‘broke‘ and under an IMF program?  Where will the money come from?\n\nI have identified two areas we can find money to use immediately:\n\n1. FOREIGN REMITTANCES\n\nWhen you conduct a comparative analysis of Ghana’s reported remittances from 2 major sources – the Auditor General’s Report and the World Bank Data, a very troubling pattern emerges:\n\nIn the years 2018 to 2022, Ghana accrued a total of $9.87 billion according to Ghana’s Auditor General’s Reports.\n\nHowever, for same period (that is, 2018 to 2022), data from the World Bank suggests that Ghana actually accrued a total $21.1 Billion. This gives us a disparity or difference of $11.23 Billion! You ask yourself, where did the difference go? Are some party big-wigs being protected?\n\nAs Head of State my administration, to the Glory of God, will address this issue by tighten the loopholes in our economy, rid the system of those exploiting the public purse, and save these sums of money that can and will be put to much better use for Ghanaians, as a whole!\n\nBy addressing this issue we would unlock access to significant financial resources for the Bank of Ghana. This will help curb currency depreciation and reduce the recurring reliance on IMF interventions to support the country's balance of payments. "
