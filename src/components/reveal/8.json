  "text": "MANIFESTO\n\nAs Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana” Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution– The Directive Principles of State Policy – shall be the basis for my Manifesto.\n\nThe Chapter contains clear objectives for all governments on areas such as: Political, Economic, Social, Educational, Cultural, International Relations and Duties as a Ghanian.\n\nIt talks about “the realization of basic human rights, a healthy economy, the right to work, the right to good health and the right to education. \n\nIt states that the State “shall seek the well-being of all her citizens” and “take all necessary action to ensure that the national economy is managed in such a manner as to maximize the rate of economic development and to secure the maximum welfare, freedom, and happiness of everyperson in Ghana…” not only those of the political elite or friends and family members of the president. \n\nIt talks about the State “safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of all persons in employment and establishing the basis for the full deployment of the creative potential of all Ghanaians.” It also talks about “guaranteeing a fair and realistic renumeration for production and productivity in order to encourage continued production and higher productivity.” Why will there be the need for labour unrest if this done.\n\nAnd in addition, the State ‘fostering an enabling environment for a pronounced role of the private sector in the economy”. To this end my government shall review all taxes, levies and fees within the first 100 days of my administration to ensure thatthey are not inimical to entrepreneurial growth and job creation.\n\nIt talks about the State taking “appropriate measures to promote the development of agriculture and industry.  To this end my government will introduce an initiative I have titled:DOMESTIC DIRECT INVESTMENTS (DDI)\n\nWhilst Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) is fashioned to attract and promote foreign investments in the country; DDI does the opposite: attracting anyone who lives in Ghana to invest their money in Ghana in by creating jobs and producing products that uses raw materials sourced in Ghana.  Businesses that qualify as DDI companies will enjoy lower taxes. \n\nChapter 6 talks about governments “as far as practicable continuing and executing projects and programs commenced by previous government. Not abandoning them as successive governments under the fourth republic have done. Causing the State to lose millions if not billions of Ghana Cedis."
