  "text": "Since 1992, there have been so many promises that both the NDC and the NPP have made, conning us into believing them, and then failing to execute!\n\nYou know it, and so do I, that these two parties are leading us nowhere but down a rabbit hole! We know it, so, why do we keep doing the same mindless thing by voting for them, and yet expecting excellent results after all their failed attempts at leadership? \n\nLadies and gentlemen, as Victor Hugo, the French writer and politician famously said, “Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.”\n\nI am of the firm belief that the time has come, – for us to seize our destiny – to take the bull by the horns and beat our own path to rapid development.\n\nTo shake off the shackles of our underdevelopment and give birth to a new Ghana that takes its rightful place in the comity of nations as the great power it should have been by now - and of that new Ghanaian who, with a revitalized mindset and sense of purpose, strives to create the Ghana we all wish to see. A Ghana that posterity will salute us for! This much, we have to see to ourselves! No one will do it for us!\n\nThis, precisely, is why I stand before you on this day that will be remembered, on this hallowed ground, ladies and gentlemen, to launch my presidential campaign as a candidate in the 2024, Presidential elections; to serve you, the good people of Ghana, as President of the Republic.\n\nArticle 57 of the 1992 Constitution states, and I quote: “There shall be a President of the Republic of Ghana who shall be the Head of State and Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana”; end quote.\n\nHowever, since the onset of the fourth Republic, we have had Presidents who have replaced the constitutional logic of a “Head of State” with the fearful use, in reality, of a “Head of Party,” instead. Our President’s unfortunate latest gaffe about not citing developmental projects in Ekumfi because his preferred candidate was booted out of Parliament some 4 years ago is a sad example of this! \n\nThese and more, account for why I stand before you, today, seeking the High Office of President to truly serve you as Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana."
