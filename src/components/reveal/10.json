Every Ghanaian will have the opportunity to pursue his or her dreams and aspirations to the fullest from the very district in which he or she lives.\n\nMy fellow Ghanaians, whether we remain here, in this stagnation, or take a leap of faith with George Twum-Barimah-Adu to Break the 2 and change course, depends on us all. Whichever path we choose will deliver its own fruit.\n\nThe fruits borne to us by the NDC and NPP in the last 32 years are clear and they include:\n\n1. an economy that is in the mud,\n\n2. a high inflationary rate,\n\n3. an inhibitive exchange regime that has left our national currency, the Ghana Cedi, floundering and difficult to plan with,\n\n4. an excruciating bank-lending regime with interest rates as high as 40 per cent,\n\n5. a plethora of nuisance taxes, fees and levies,\n\n6. a deadly cocktail of debt and frequent visits to the IMF,\n\n7. poor roads, schools, hospitals, high youth unemployment,\n\n8. run-away corruption,\n\n9. uncontrolled galamsey and polluted water bodies,\n\n10. an unbearable national debt; and\n\n11. dumsor, just to mention a few."
