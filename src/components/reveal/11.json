  "text": "The choice is ours; the ball is in our court – and it is my strongest belief that we will not fail but succeed, by trusting God and voting for George Twum-Barimah-Adu in this year’s presidential elections.\n\nFor us, it is very simple. To break the two and  fix what has gone wrong, and to demonstrate to all Ghanaians good governance and proper, servant leadership and stewardship. And to make true the statement by Ghana’s first President, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah that the African is capable of managing his own affairs.\n\nBefore I conclude, I would like to use the next few minutes to elaborate briefly on the flag for my candidacy, launch my presidential bid, and then we shall listen to the official theme song or jingle for my campaign.\n\nThe Flag:\n\nAs you can see projected here, the flag of my candidacy has a number of colours: \n\nBlood Red: The larger mass of red (blood red) represents the blood spilled by our forebears, over time, in the supreme interest of Ghana and Ghanaians.\n\nGreen: This colour is representative of the vegetation and plant resources of Ghana.\n\nWhite: This colour stands for the Purity of the people – a purity that we shall strive to make commonplace among Ghana’s people – in whatever we undertake.\n\nRed: This lighter shade of red stands for the Sacrifices expected of us all – not the shedding of our blood but the willingness to yield everything possible – in order that Ghana can become what we all desire our Motherland to be.Gold: This colour represents the Wealth of the nation - to be put to use for the benefit of all the people.\n\nBlack: This colour, as I am sure some of you may have rightly guessed by now, stands for our race – humble, gentle Black People!\n\nWith all the colours making-up the pattern in the green circle symbolizing “togetherness” – different people with different cultures, yet a common Goal of progress. \n\nWith that, my dear friends of Ghana, I, George Twum-Barimah Adu, wish to officially launch my bid for Ghana’s presidency.  \n\nI would also like to sincerely appeal to all of you – all of you, without exemption, to help us! This is not just my dream, but yours too! If we make Ghana into that dreamland, we do that for us all!"
