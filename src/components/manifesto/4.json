  "text": "My fellow Ghanaians, whether we remain here, in this stagnation, or take a leap of faith with George Twum-Barimah-Adu to Break the 2 and change course, depends on us all. Whichever path we choose will deliver its own fruit. The fruits borne to us by the NDC and NPP in the last 32 years are clear and they include:\n\n1. an economy that is in the mud, \n\n2. a high inflationary rate,\n\n3. an inhibitive exchange regime that has left our national currency, the Ghana Cedi, floundering and difficult to plan with,\n\n4. an excruciating bank-lending regime with interest rates as high as 40 per cent,\n\n5. a plethora of nuisance taxes, fees and levies,\n\n6. a deadly cocktail of debt and frequent visits to the IMF,\n\n7. poor roads, schools, hospitals, high youth unemployment,\n\n8. run-away corruption,\n\n9. uncontrolled galamsey and polluted water bodies,\n\n10. an unbearable national debt; and\n\n11. dumsor, just to mention a few.\n\nThe choice is ours; the ball is in our court – and it is my strongest belief that we will notfail but succeed, by trusting God and voting for George Twum-Barimah-Adu in this year’s presidential elections.\n\nFor us, it is very simple. To break the two and  fix what has gone wrong, and to demonstrate to all Ghanaians good governance and proper, servant leadership and stewardship. And to make true the statement by Ghana’s first President, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah that the African is capable of managing his own affairs."
