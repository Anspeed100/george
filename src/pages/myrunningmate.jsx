Ghana is at the crossroads of a development crisis of historic magnitude which has become a tangible reality of which everyone is aware and whoever have this in mind would settle on a choice with the requisite intellectual depth and experience to navigate the current crisis, and not the current political circuses Ghana is being subjected to by NPP and NDC.
