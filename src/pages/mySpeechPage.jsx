            My distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life, Niimei, Naamei, Nananom, brothers and sisters, partners in the enterprise of making Ghana become the best version of itself in order that we all may be beneficiaries:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I greet you!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I am George Twum-Barimah-Adu. I am a father of three and married to my beautiful wife, Winifred, who due to surgery, could not join us today. I take this opportunity to wish her a speedy recovery from her surgery.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Beloved brothers and sisters, we have invited you to an event that we have dubbed “The Reveal” – and for very good reason.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Why “The Reveal?” We chose this title because my team and I seek, with this gathering, to reignite the tough conversations that ought to be had, to spur the birth of ideas, pathways, and policies – a blueprint that can, effectively and efficiently, change the negative course of Ghana – and guide it to a more resilient and prosperous one, built on the very tenets on which the 4th Republic of Ghana, right from its inception, was meant to be anchored: probity, integrity, accountability, and that moral character that generates true selfless servant-leadership.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It also is an opportunity for me to elaborate on who I am, and why, as might be obvious, at this point, I seek to lead this country, Ghana, as President – and to share what my plan is.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I would like to commence it all, however, by taking a short trip down memory lane:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Growing up, my dear friends and fellow Ghanaians I blossomed in a Ghana which, from where I sat, was filled with promise. Today, however, all we have are the empty promises of an entitled political class! I remember chancing recently upon the Daily Graphic edition of Thursday, March 7, 1957, a day after our beloved nation, Ghana, attained independence, with a caption that read: “What the World Says about Ghana.”
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            In that story, it was clear that while there were those who felt our then newborn nation would not succeed, there were many, too, that were optimistic about this new nation and the greatness that could be born from it.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            At the dawn of Ghana's independence on the 6th of March, 1957, it was much better placed to attain rapid socio-economic development, compared to the likes of Malaysia, South Korea, and India. Ghana had a booming population that could spur rapid economic growth, with education and proper skills training being the needed catalysts to make this a reality. It had natural resources that many other nations could only dream of.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Ghana, our Ghana, has always been a nation blessed to the point of repletion with human and natural resources. Yet today's Ghana, with the same resources as back then, and, in fact, a lot more, cannot be celebrated or exalted as we were some almost 67 years ago. Today's Ghana under the fourth Republic cannot hold a candle to the one we left behind, in a bid to make greater strides.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            But where, exactly, did we lose the plot?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            While the lack of proper leadership, coupled with the decay in governance systems and the loss of patriotism in our politics did not start today, I shall say this, and forcefully so: the NDC and the NPP, our country’s foremost political parties in this Fourth Republic, have shown themselves to be no more than two sides of the same coin who alternate in power. In fact, I daresay that the NDC and the NPP are conjoined twins; they go into opposition from time to time, but never really leave power.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            How many times have we not heard of how, even in opposition, these two political parties have hobnobbed in scheming to make poorer and poorer the ordinary Ghanaian while their party loyalists have become richer and richer? Yes, they may go into opposition, but they still remain beneficiaries of a warped system that continues to feed their greed and entitled posture – while the masses struggle to even eke out a living! A very good example of this is the repulsive ex-gratia payments they make to themselves after every 4-year political cycle, using taxpayers’ money – without any input whatsoever from the taxpayer.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The fact that every one of these administrations, be it of NDC or NPP stock, has gone, cup in hand, to the IMF since 1995 is a case in point! I ask: if they knew the way to real economic growth and prosperity, would they not have shown same, and would we not have witnessed those capabilities after all these terms in office?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Since 1992, there have been so many promises that both the NDC and the NPP have made, conning us into believing them, and then failing to execute!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            You know it, and so do I, that these two parties are leading us nowhere but down a rabbit hole! We know it, so, why do we keep doing the same mindless thing by voting for them, and yet expecting excellent results after all their failed attempts at leadership?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Ladies and gentlemen, as Victor Hugo, the French writer and politician famously said, “Nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.”
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I am of the firm belief that the time has come, – for us to seize our destiny – to take the bull by the horns and beat our own path to rapid development.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            To shake off the shackles of our underdevelopment and give birth to a new Ghana that takes its rightful place in the comity of nations as the great power it should have been by now - and of that new Ghanaian who, with a revitalized mindset and sense of purpose, strives to create the Ghana we all wish to see. A Ghana that posterity will salute us for! This much, we have to see to ourselves! No one will do it for us!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            This, precisely, is why I stand before you on this day that will be remembered, on this hallowed ground, ladies and gentlemen, to launch my presidential campaign as a candidate in the 2024 Presidential elections; to serve you, the good people of Ghana, as President of the Republic.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Article 57 of the 1992 Constitution states, and I quote: “There shall be a President of the Republic of Ghana who shall be the Head of State and Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana”; end quote.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            However, since the onset of the fourth Republic, we have had Presidents who have replaced the constitutional logic of a “Head of State” with the fearful use, in reality, of a “Head of Party,” instead. Our President’s unfortunate latest gaffe about not citing developmental projects in Ekumfi because his preferred candidate was booted out of Parliament some 4 years ago is a sad example of this!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            These and more, account for why I stand before you, today, seeking the High Office of President to truly serve you as Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I am doing this because I fervently believe it is time to forge a brighter future for every Ghanaian and not only for those who belong to the political party of the President in power.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I will be a Head of State for the people! One who brings about destiny-changing transformation!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            That is why the slogan for my campaign is “Breaking the Two”; and the motto of my candidacy is, “Y3 gye ay3 no yie.” Simply put, “We are taking on governance to make it truly work”. A Head of State (not Head of Party) who serves the needs of all the people and create wealth for everyone.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Why “Breaking the Two” and why “Y3 gye ay3 no yie”?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Permit me to start off with the slogan:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>Breaking The Two.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It depicts, as initially comes to mind, a breaking of the foothold these two known political parties, the NDC and the NPP, have had in Ghana’s politics over recent decades. It is now clear more than ever, that until we extricate ourselves from the tyranny of these two non-performing conjoined twins, we shall continue to have Presidents who serve only their party and its supporters and not the totality of Ghanaians. A scenario which so far as we can see has taken our nation nowhere.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            At the time Ghana was declared a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) under former President Kufuor, Ghana had a debt overhead of only $6.6 Billion in 2003, of which a whopping $4.3 Billion was shaved off, through debt cancellation, leading to a debt profile (including other write-offs) of about $780 Million or 25% of GDP when HIPC ended in 2006.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The NDC, when it took over in 2009, catapulted our public debt from GHS 9.8 Billion to GHS 122.6 Billion, or 73.3% of our GDP in 2016.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            But if that was bad, the NPP did and is doing even worse today!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            By June 2023, this NPP administration had borrowed to the tune of GHS 581.5 Billion! And as of this year, our government projects to borrow a further GHS 94.4 Billion in Treasury Bills to finance its expenditure!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Ladies and gentlemen, after 32 years of experimenting with these two political parties which have done nothing but aimlessly tinker with our economy and all other aspects of our national life, we are left with a staggering debt baggage of some 600 Billion Ghana Cedis.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            All this debt, my brothers and sisters, was contracted when one party (either the NDC or the NPP) controlled both the Presidency and Parliament. The practice, therefore, where, as voters we give one political party both the executive and legislature has not helped the country.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            For 32 years these two political parties have played Ping-Pong with us: alternating in power, only to loot and share among themselves – to the utter detriment and impoverishment of the majority of Ghanaian!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Our road network, which I came face to face with as I toured 264 out of Ghana’s 268 Districts is in shambles. (I couldn’t enter the remaining 4 Districts owing to the sad and turbulent situation in Bawku). These are death traps waiting to devour human lives, and we look on! We still have schools under trees in Ghana today, as I speak – thousands of them!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            As of October 2023, Ghana had 2,417 schools under trees!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            We were coaxed into believing that galamsey would be taken out, root and branch, with President Akufo-Addo putting his presidency on the line – as a pledge. Galamsey, today, is a hydra-headed demon that our own politicians and party executives are using to enrich themselves!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            We were promised an incorruptible leadership devoid of family and friends arrangements. Today we all know and see that, that is not the case.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            These abuses of power are what I stand here, before you, to lead the charge to correct!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            This is some of the deceitfulness in our public leadership that we need to check now, or else, forever hold our peace! This is why we mean to “Break the 2” and, by so doing, break the stranglehold these two parties have had on our political life! We cannot bequeath a broke, failing Ghana to posterity, so, I call on you to help me “Break the 2” and rescue Ghana!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Now, more than ever, we need to rein in our retrogressive political leadership and change course. We need to put a stop to this vicious cycle of the NDC and the NPP, lest we veer off into a disastrous oblivion as a people and end up in our economic grave! We must break the two, good people of Ghana, and I strongly believe that this is also the Will of God!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Now why, “Y3 gye aye no yie!”
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            After we have broken the two, we must make governance truly work and serve the needs of the people and help create wealth. However, one may ask, how will this be executed, since we are ‘broke‘ and under an IMF program? Where will the money come from?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I have identified two areas we can find money to use immediately:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>1. FOREIGN REMITTANCES</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            When you conduct a comparative analysis of Ghana’s reported remittances from 2 major sources – the Auditor General’s Report and the World Bank Data, a very troubling pattern emerges:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            In the years 2018 to 2022, Ghana accrued a total of $9.87 billion according to Ghana’s Auditor General’s Reports.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            However, for the same period (that is, 2018 to 2022), data from the World Bank suggests that Ghana actually accrued a total $21.1 Billion. This gives us a disparity or difference of $11.23 Billion! You ask yourself, where did the difference go? Are some party big-wigs being protected?
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            As Head of State, my administration, to the Glory of God, will address this issue by tightening the loopholes in our economy, rid the system of those exploiting the public purse, and save these sums of money that can and will be put to much better use for Ghanaians, as a whole!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            By addressing this issue, we would unlock access to significant financial resources for the Bank of Ghana. This will help curb currency depreciation and reduce the recurring reliance on IMF interventions to support the country's balance of payments.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>2. CUTTING DOWN ON GOVERNMENT’S EXPENDITURE AND WASTE:</strong>
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <li>Selling non-profitable state enterprises.</li>
            <li>Scrutinizing Public Procurement and strictly reviewing contracts to guarantee value for money.</li>
            <li>Downsizing government as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that no government entity (including SOEs) sign any contract or memorandum with any party without government review, input, and approval.</li>
            <li>Cutting down on unnecessary public expenditure, by operating within the constitutionally approved number of 19 Cabinet Ministers, with a total Ministerial count of sixty-three (63).</li>
            <li>Instituting a cap on the value of state vehicles used by all government officials including SOEs.</li>
            <li>Suspending all government and SOEs’ travels pending a review, unless essential travels carefully vetted to deliver value for money.</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            All these measures put together, and many more, will save the nation millions if not billions of cedis annually, surely, putting our beloved country, Ghana, on a far better economic pedestal than we are at now! Through these measures, we shall plug the loopholes of criminal enrichment and corruption and stem the tide of wastage in government!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            This is why together, you and I must break the two, na yen y3 no yie, so that we can be able to implement our Manifesto to ensure that governance is working and serving the people and at the same time, helping create wealth.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Manifesto</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            As Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana” Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution– The Directive Principles of State Policy – shall be the basis for my Manifesto.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The Chapter contains clear objectives for all governments on areas such as: Political, Economic, Social, Educational, Cultural, International Relations and Duties as a Ghanian.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about “the realization of basic human rights, a healthy economy, the right to work, the right to good health and the right to education.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It states that the State “shall seek the well-being of all her citizens” and “take all necessary action to ensure that the national economy is managed in such a manner as to maximize the rate of economic development and to secure the maximum welfare, freedom, and happiness of every person in Ghana…” not only those of the political elite or friends and family members of the president.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about the State “safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of all persons in employment and establishing the basis for the full deployment of the creative potential of all Ghanaians.” It also talks about “guaranteeing a fair and realistic renumeration for production and productivity in order to encourage continued production and higher productivity.” Why will there be the need for labour unrest if this done.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            And in addition, the State ‘fostering an enabling environment for a pronounced role of the private sector in the economy”. To this end my government shall review all taxes, levies and fees within the first 100 days of my administration to ensure that they are not inimical to entrepreneurial growth and job creation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about the State taking “appropriate measures to promote the development of agriculture and industry. To this end my government will introduce an initiative I have titled:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>DOMESTIC DIRECT INVESTMENTS (DDI)</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Whilst Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) is fashioned to attract and promote foreign investments in the country; DDI does the opposite: attracting anyone who lives in Ghana to invest their money in Ghana in by creating jobs and producing products that uses raw materials sourced in Ghana. Businesses that qualify as DDI companies will enjoy lower taxes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Chapter 6 talks about governments “as far as practicable continuing and executing projects and programs commenced by previous government. Not abandoning them as successive governments under the fourth republic have done. Causing the State to lose millions if not billions of Ghana Cedis.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about the “state promoting a culture of political tolerance amongst Ghanaians. Instead, what we have today, is a political culture that promotes only hate, division and intolerance.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It states that the State “shall take steps to eradicate corrupt practices and the abuse of state power”. Instead under the NDC and the NPP what we have witnessed is a system of, “create, loot and share”. Contracts being awarded without recourse to the Procurement Act. Monies, including foreign exchange being found in the homes of government ministers, and many such blatant corrupt practices.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Chapter 6 also talks about so many other things including: “the state taking measures needed to protect and safeguard the national environment for posterity”; instead, today what we see and read is the wanton and blatant destruction of our national environment including water bodies by all manner of persons including politicians and to make matters worse, the passage of legislation to further abuse our environment. Here I am talking about LI 2462. To this effect my government, in consultation with relevant and interested parties in the sector, shall repeal LI 2462, in respect of regulation concerning the ability to mine in Forest Reserves and enforce environmental protection for the benefit of us all – and for our future generations!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            As Head of State, my government will fight the menace of galamsey without fear nor favour, with enforcement of existing laws, passing new laws where necessary, tightening loopholes in existing laws, and providing alternative livelihoods such as: Carbon Credit harvesting and a legal Industrial Hemp industry to the youth in galamsey and other Ghanaians who want to venture into those areas.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about “even and balanced development of all regions and every part of each region of Ghana, and, in particular, improving the condition of life in the rural areas, and generally, redressing any imbalance in development between the rural and the urban areas”.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            To this end, as Head of State, my government will pursue a policy of development based on the premise that if every part of each region is developed then Ghana is developed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            And to improve the conditions of life in each district we will promote a Policy Program we have termed:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>DISTRICT CONTRACTS FOR YOUTH</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            This policy will ensure that contracts that are not complicated that are to be executed by government through the MMDA’s are awarded to qualified youths who live in the district; with the condition that unskilled workers who will execute the job must live in the district for at least three months.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Finally, it states amongst other things that “the State shall take all necessary steps so as to ensure the full integration of women into the mainstream of the economic development of Ghana.” This we shall achieve by deliberately pursuing pro-woman policies both in the public sector and encouraging the private sector to do same.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            In addition to the above, and in our quest to create wealth for Ghanaians, we shall prioritize agriculture, the creative arts, tourism, security and develop programs to uplift marginalized communities, strive our hardest to eradicate poverty, and work manfully to bridge the disparity divide between the south and the north of Ghana.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            No longer will the fate of individuals be determined by their social or economic backgrounds; or the districts in which they live or the political party they belong. Every Ghanaian will have the opportunity to pursue his or her dreams and aspirations to the fullest from the very district in which he or she lives.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            My fellow Ghanaians, whether we remain here, in this stagnation, or take a leap of faith with George Twum-Barimah-Adu to Break the 2 and change course, depends on us all. Whichever path we choose will deliver its own fruit.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The fruits borne to us by the NDC and NPP in the last 32 years are clear and they include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <li>An economy that is in the mud</li>
            <li>A high inflationary rate</li>
            <li>An inhibitive exchange regime that has left our national currency, the Ghana Cedi, floundering and difficult to plan with</li>
            <li>An excruciating bank-lending regime with interest rates as high as 40 per cent</li>
            <li>A plethora of nuisance taxes, fees and levies</li>
            <li>A deadly cocktail of debt and frequent visits to the IMF</li>
            <li>Poor roads, schools, hospitals, high youth unemployment</li>
            <li>Run-away corruption</li>
            <li>Uncontrolled galamsey and polluted water bodies</li>
            <li>An unbearable national debt</li>
            <li>Dumsor, just to mention a few</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The choice is ours; the ball is in our court – and it is my strongest belief that we will not fail but succeed, by trusting God and voting for George Twum-Barimah-Adu in this year’s presidential elections.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            For us, it is very simple. To break the two and fix what has gone wrong, and to demonstrate to all Ghanaians good governance and proper, servant leadership and stewardship. And to make true the statement by Ghana’s first President, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah that the African is capable of managing his own affairs.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Before I conclude, I would like to use the next few minutes to elaborate briefly on the flag for my candidacy, launch my presidential bid, and then we shall listen to the official theme song or jingle for my campaign.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Flag:</h2>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            As you can see projected here, the flag of my candidacy has a number of colours:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>Blood Red:</strong> The larger mass of red (blood red) represents the blood spilled by our forebears, over time, in the supreme interest of Ghana and Ghanaians.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>Green:</strong> This colour is representative of the vegetation and plant resources of Ghana.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>White:</strong> This colour stands for the Purity of the people – a purity that we shall strive to make commonplace among Ghana’s people – in whatever we undertake.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>Red:</strong> This lighter shade of red stands for the Sacrifices expected of us all – not the shedding of our blood but the willingness to yield everything possible – in order that Ghana can become what we all desire our Motherland to be.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>Gold:</strong> This colour represents the Wealth of the nation - to be put to use for the benefit of all the people.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>Black:</strong> This colour, as I am sure some of you may have rightly guessed by now, stands for our race – humble, gentle Black People!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            With all the colours making-up the pattern in the green circle symbolizing “togetherness” – different people with different cultures, yet a common Goal of progress.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            With that, my dear friends of Ghana, I, George Twum-Barimah-Adu, wish to officially launch my bid for Ghana’s presidency.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I would also like to sincerely appeal to all of you – all of you, without exemption, to help us! This is not just my dream, but yours too! If we make Ghana into that dreamland, we do that for us all!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I offer you:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <li>Servant-leadership.</li>
            <li>Efficient and effective leadership.</li>
            <li>Honest and incorruptible leadership.</li>
            <li>Leadership of respect.</li>
            <li>Leadership for the benefit of all, and not a small group of family, friends and cronies.</li>
            <li>Leadership that plans for the future without destroying the present.</li>
            <li>A leadership of ideas; and</li>
            <li>A leadership that is all-embracing, transparent and trustworthy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I am calling on all to join forces so we can make Ghana, our own Ghana, the land of our dreams!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            At this juncture, I would like to seize the moment to call on all of you who believe in this dream that I have shared with you for a shared prosperity – those who wish to volunteer their time, energy, and resources of whatever form, please go by the Volunteer Table (which is right outside the main entrance to this hall) to sign up.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            No matter how small or big, be sure to donate!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I am calling on all of you, Ghanaians – not just those here – to donate to my campaign, so we can make Ghana a real home fit for us, our children, and their children after them.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            This is my GENUINE PLEDGE to you all: I George Twum-Barimah-Adu, will serve you in honesty and dignity, that God may be glorified, and that Ghana and Ghanaians shall be truly free and enjoy the boons God has so generously bestowed upon us.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            I am George Twum-Barimah-Adu, and I want, with your support and vote, to be your President – to serve you as Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            God bless Ghana, our Motherland, and make Her Great and Strong!
