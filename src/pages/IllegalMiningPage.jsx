    Article 36 clause 9 under Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution of Ghana, states that “the state shall take appropriate measures needed to protect and safeguard the national environment for posterity … .” 
      <br /><br />
      Instead, today what we see and read is the crass and blatant destruction of our national environment including water bodies and forest cover by all manner of persons including state actors (politicians). What is happening today is environmental genocide which has the potential to affect the survivability of our nation and people. The overhyped political infrastructural development is of no consequence to a nation when the very foundation of its life is under threat.
      <br /><br />
      The Colonial Policy of appropriating community natural resources for central control and exploitation is the root cause of the current illegal mining saga. This age-long colonial policy of appropriating minerals and other natural resources of value from the communities for crown control has outlived its relevance and is the main reason for the devastation of our forest resources and Water bodies through politically engineered concessions from Accra. Which side-steps and clips the wings of Traditional Leaders, whose primary mandate is to protect the forests, and water bodies, not only as communal resource heritage and sanctuaries of their gods but also the life of the unborn generation.
      <br /><br />
      The interlocking colonial crown policy of granting concessions from Accra and the exclusion of The Traditional Sector in the current unipolar institutional governance model constitute the dysfunctional process mechanism being weaponized against our very existence as humans. 
      <br /><br />
      The historiography of colonial/crown land use policies in Africa were driven by exploitation as the principal interest and that underpinned all acts governing lands and resource management of which Ghana is not an exception.  
      <br /><br />
      The British manipulation of laws to take over the land and other resources of the people for crown control has continued to date after independence when colonial structures were left intact.

      <h2 className="mb-6 mt-6 text-center text-2xl text-black font-canarobold">The matrix of open-access resource security and community exigencies </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
      Open-Access Resources (Land, Flora & Fauna/Mineral resources within) are integral part of Communities Resource Area and Heritage (CORAH). 
      <br /><br />
      There are customary laws and conventions that govern the use and preservation of these open-access resources. 
      <br /><br />
      The moment an external entity appropriates the right to exploit these resources under the ruse of state interest to the exclusion of the indigenous community; and the indigenous community is made to bear the cost of exploitation, the community is compelled to take an offensive posture against their resources area with dire consequences. It is this crown colonial policy mentality over resource exploitation from the communities that underlies the current danger which could be appropriately described as a crime against humanity.
      <br /><br /></p>
      <h2 className="mb-6 mt-6 text-center text-2xl text-black font-canarobold">The Environmental Protection (Mining in Forest Reserves) Regulation LI 2462</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
      The passage of this legislation in November 2022 giving the President the authority to allow mining and prospecting in forest reserves if he deems it necessary in the national interest bears all the hallmarks of colonial land control systems for exploitation by a predatory political culture. The quest for independence was but a substitution of white rule for indigenous tyranny whilst the structures of exploitation remained intact.</p>

      <h2 className="mb-6 mt-6 text-center text-2xl text-black font-canarobold">The The Traditional Sector Partnership in the Management of Open-Access Resources: The Triple Helix Partnership Approach</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
      The time has now come for a new framework for consensus building towards a Developmental Model, with the inclusion of the Traditional Sector as partners in the Agreement, Management and Benefit sharing of Land Resources as well as its preservation within the framework of the Communities/Traditional Area Values and Heritage systems. </p>

      <h2 className="mb-6 mt-6 text-center text-2xl text-black font-canarobold">Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Environmental Management</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
        
      Poverty eradication and sustainable environmental management can only become a reality under an all-inclusive Public-Private-Traditional Sector Partnership, especially in the management of Open-Access Resources, which is part of the Traditional Sector Resource Area, but for which an age-old crown colonial policy excluded communities.

      <br /><br />
      When the Resource Area Proximate Traditional Sector/Community is excluded from the Management and Benefit sharing of open-access resources, the indigenes are compelled by coping exigencies to take an offensive posture against their own environment as a survival coping strategy especially in the absence of any meaningful job prospect and a definite accountability policy. 
      <br /><br />
      Ghana is said to be currently Africa’s top gold producer and an oil producing county, yet poverty is widespread and further exacerbated by the Neo-Colonial-Debt -Trap and its taxing consequences on businesses and the population, including pensioners. How can one justify and celebrate this status when thousands of schools are still under trees; Twenty-first century major inter-national and intra-national roads are still in single-lanes and poorly lit, devouring breadwinning Ghanaians in horrific numbers on regular basis through head-on collisions and the frightening threat of staggering youth unemployment. 
      <br /><br />
      If the Existing Regime and order cannot protect our forests resources and water bodies, secure our wellbeing and welfare and guarantee dividends from these resources to the communities, the fundamental thing for Ghana and Ghanaians to do on December 7th, 2024, is Break the current duopoly (that has caged Ghana and Ghanaians) for thirty-two years and usher in a New Order. 
      <br /><br />
      As President, Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana, my pledge to Ghana and Ghanaians is to fight the menace of illegal mining (galamsey) without fear nor favour, with:
      <br />
      1. Full enforcement of existing laws.
      <br />
      2. Repealing LI 2462.
      <br />
      3. Passing new laws where necessary.
      <br />
      4. Tightening loopholes in existing laws.
      <br />
      5. Providing alternative livelihoods such as: Carbon Credit harvesting and a legal industrial hemp industry to the youth in illegal mining (galamsey) and other Ghanaians who want to venture into those areas; and

      <br />
      6. Establishing a new developmental framework involving public-private-traditional sectors.
