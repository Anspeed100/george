            <strong>As Head of State, Head of Government and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ghana</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Chapter 6 of the 1992 Constitution– The Directive Principles of State Policy – shall be the basis for my Manifesto.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The Chapter contains clear objectives for all governments on areas such as: Political, Economic, Social, Educational, Cultural, International Relations and Duties as a Ghanian.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about “the realization of basic human rights, a healthy economy, the right to work, the right to good health and the right to education. 
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It states that the State “shall seek the well-being of all her citizens” and “take all necessary action to ensure that the national economy is managed in such a manner as to maximize the rate of economic development and to secure the maximum welfare, freedom, and happiness of every person in Ghana…” not only those of the political elite or friends and family members of the president.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about the State “safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of all persons in employment and establishing the basis for the full deployment of the creative potential of all Ghanaians.” It also talks about “guaranteeing a fair and realistic renumeration for production and productivity in order to encourage continued production and higher productivity.” Why will there be the need for labour unrest if this done.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            And in addition, the State ‘fostering an enabling environment for a pronounced role of the private sector in the economy”. To this end my government shall review all taxes, levies and fees within the first 100 days of my administration to ensure that they are not inimical to entrepreneurial growth and job creation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about the State taking “appropriate measures to promote the development of agriculture and industry. To this end my government will introduce an initiative I have titled:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>DOMESTIC DIRECT INVESTMENTS (DDI)</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Whilst Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) is fashioned to attract and promote foreign investments in the country; DDI does the opposite: attracting anyone who lives in Ghana to invest their money in Ghana in by creating jobs and producing products that uses raw materials sourced in Ghana. Businesses that qualify as DDI companies will enjoy lower taxes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Chapter 6 talks about governments “as far as practicable continuing and executing projects and programs commenced by previous government. Not abandoning them as successive governments under the fourth republic have done. Causing the State to lose millions if not billions of Ghana Cedis.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about the “state promoting a culture of political tolerance amongst Ghanaians. Instead, what we have today, is a political culture that promotes only hate, division and intolerance.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It states that the State “shall take steps to eradicate corrupt practices and the abuse of state power”. Instead under the NDC and the NPP what we have witnessed is a system of, “create, loot and share”. Contracts being awarded without recourse to the Procurement Act. Monies, including foreign exchange being found in the homes of government ministers, and many such blatant corrupt practices.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Chapter 6 also talks about so many other things including: “the state taking measures needed to protect and safeguard the national environment for posterity”; instead, today what we see and read is the wanton and blatant destruction of our national environment including water bodies by all manner of persons including politicians and to make matters worse, the passage of legislation to further abuse our environment. Here I am talking about LI 2462. To this effect my government, in consultation with relevant and interested parties in the sector, shall repeal LI 2462, in respect of regulation concerning the ability to mine in Forest Reserves and enforce environmental protection for the benefit of us all – and for our future generations!
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            As Head of State, my government will fight the menace of galamsey without fear nor favour, with enforcement of existing laws, passing new laws where necessary, tightening loopholes in existing laws, and providing alternative livelihoods such as: Carbon Credit harvesting and a legal Industrial Hemp industry to the youth in galamsey and other Ghanaians who want to venture into those areas.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            It talks about “even and balanced development of all regions and every part of each region of Ghana, and, in particular, improving the condition of life in the rural areas, and generally, redressing any imbalance in development between the rural and the urban areas”.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            To this end, as Head of State, my government will pursue a policy of development based on the premise that if every part of each region is developed then Ghana is developed.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            And to improve the conditions of life in each district we will promote a Policy Program we have termed:
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <strong>DISTRICT CONTRACTS FOR YOUTH</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            This policy will ensure that contracts that are not complicated that are to be executed by government through the MMDA’s are awarded to qualified youths who live in the district; with the condition that unskilled workers who will execute the job must live in the district for at least three months.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            Finally, it states amongst other things that “the State shall take all necessary steps so as to ensure the full integration of women into the mainstream of the economic development of Ghana.” This we shall achieve by deliberately pursuing pro-woman policies both in the public sector and encouraging the private sector to do same.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            In addition to the above, and in our quest to create wealth for Ghanaians, we shall priorities agriculture, the creative arts, tourism, security and develop program to uplift marginalized communities, strive our hardest to eradicate poverty, and work manfully to bridge the disparity divide between the south and the north of Ghana.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            No longer will the fate of individuals be determined by their social or economic backgrounds; or the districts in which they live or the political party they belong. Every Ghanaian will have the opportunity to pursue his or her dreams and aspirations to the fullest from the very district in which he or she lives.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            My fellow Ghanaians, whether we remain here, in this stagnation, or take a leap of faith with George Twum-Barimah-Adu to Break the 2 and change course, depends on us all. Whichever path we choose will deliver its own fruit.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The fruits borne to us by the NDC and NPP in the last 32 years are clear and they include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            <li>An economy that is in the mud</li>
            <li>A high inflationary rate</li>
            <li>An inhibitive exchange regime that has left our national currency, the Ghana Cedi, floundering and difficult to plan with</li>
            <li>An excruciating bank-lending regime with interest rates as high as 40 per cent</li>
            <li>A plethora of nuisance taxes, fees and levies</li>
            <li>A deadly cocktail of debt and frequent visits to the IMF</li>
            <li>Poor roads, schools, hospitals, high youth unemployment</li>
            <li>Run-away corruption</li>
            <li>Uncontrolled galamsey and polluted water bodies</li>
            <li>An unbearable national debt</li>
            <li>Dumsor, just to mention a few</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            The choice is ours; the ball is in our court – and it is my strongest belief that we will not fail but succeed, by trusting God and voting for George Twum-Barimah-Adu in this year’s presidential elections.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6 text-left text-black font-canarobook">
            For us, it is very simple. To break the two and fix what has gone wrong, and to demonstrate to all Ghanaians good governance and proper, servant leadership and stewardship. And to make true the statement by Ghana’s first President, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah that the African is capable of managing his own affairs.
